The past decade has witnessed a proliferation of data, where the notion of data science plays a central role in the envisioned many technological advances. A number of applications (like the online recommendation systems, the automatic driving systems, the financial Robo-Advisor systems, etc.) involving big data have already brought huge benefits to many facets of our daily lives. Advances in data analytics motivate a systematic way to uncover the hidden insights, mining the useful information, and carrying forward inferences from these massive datasets. My overarching objective of research is to wed state-of-the-art high-performance methods with the emerging big data problems, in a way that they can inspire and reinforce the development of each other, with the ultimate goal of benefiting our societies.


My some lines of research:

- Mathematical (especially algorithmic and statistical) foundations of signal processing, machine learning, and data science

- Signal processing and machine learning for financial systems

- Signal processing and machine learning for sensing and communication systems

- Computer Vision, SLAM & LLM

- Robotics & Reinforcement Learning
